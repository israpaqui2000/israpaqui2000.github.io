Project analysis, Information architecture: describe using around 200 words (minimum) how you have distributed the page’s information:


The site's structure is organized into well-defined sections that allow users to quickly access information. In total, I've divided it into six clear and defined sections.

- On the homepage, I've included a brief description of who I am, so that anyone reading this can quickly and concisely understand who I am. I've also included several fake social media links.

- In the "About Me" section, I delve deeper into my work philosophy, experience, and professional challenges. My goal here is to explain and elaborate on what I'm passionate about, what I can contribute to the company, and above all, to open up and explain my goals and dreams.

- In the "Services" section, I explain in detail which programs I use and the types of work I do. I've included the three programs I have the most experience with. I've also emphasized my understanding of these programs by explaining what I do with them and which specific tools I use.

-In the skills section, I present a concise overview of my technical and professional skills.

-In the portfolio, I showcase my three best projects along with a description of what I did and what type of project it was.

-In the contact section, I've included my phone number and social media links.



Project analysis, Visual design: describe using around 200 words
(minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design.


To choose my visual style, I opted for a muted color palette, creating strong contrast where color appears but doesn't dominate. To make it easier to understand, I've divided my style into five main points.

- Color Palette: Neutral tones combined with accents of violet and blue to convey creativity and professionalism. I didn't want to use overly bright colors because for a CV, it's best not to tire the reader's eyes with very flashy colors.

- Typography: I used legible sans-serif fonts with good contrast, highlighting titles and skill percentages. This way, I separate and encourage the reader to focus on certain aspects, such as highlighting important skills in bold.

- Iconography: To avoid overwhelming the page with text, I opted to display certain information, such as professional skills with percentages and technical skills with progress bars.

- Animations: I added animations and some transitions to make the page feel more dynamic and less static. I've also made it so that certain elements change color when the user hovers over them.

In short, the goal of my design has been to create a coherent, attractive, and professional visual experience.
